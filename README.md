# Change-Background-Colour
This project allows users to change the background color of a webpage by clicking on different buttons. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve this interactive functionality.

Features:

Multiple buttons for various background color options.
User-friendly interface for easy background customization.
Clean and lightweight code structure.
Getting Started:

Download the files: Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Open the files: Use a text editor or code editor to open the following files:
index.html: The main HTML file containing the webpage structure.
styles.css: The CSS file defining the styling of the elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file handling the background change logic.
Run the project: Open index.html in your web browser to start the application.
Project Structure:

index.html: This file defines the basic structure of the webpage. It includes elements like buttons and a container for the background color display. It also links the styles.css and script.js files for styling and interactivity.
styles.css: This file provides the visual design for the elements. It defines styles for the buttons, container, and potentially other elements present in the index.html file.
script.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the button clicks and background color changes. It listens for clicks on the buttons and dynamically updates the background color of the designated container element using JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities.
Functionality:

When the webpage loads, users will see a set of buttons representing different background color options. Clicking on a button triggers the JavaScript code, which retrieves the chosen color value associated with that button. The script then uses this value to modify the background-color property of the container element in the HTML, effectively changing the background color of the webpage.

Customization:

You can easily modify the number of buttons and their associated colors by editing the HTML and JavaScript code.
You can adjust the styling of the buttons and container using CSS to create a unique look and feel.
Further Enhancements:

Add functionality to allow users to choose custom background colors using an input field.
Include background image options alongside color options.
Implement animations for a more dynamic user experience when changing the background.
Conclusion:

This project provides a basic example of interactive web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to personalize their experience and serves as a foundation for building more complex interactive applications in the future.
